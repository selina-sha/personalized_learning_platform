# Motivation
Our online education platform fills a gap by offering a fair space for all educators and learners. Unlike traditional platforms that require teachers to be linked with big institutions, our site lets anyone sign up without complex rules or strict tests. This way, hobbyists, freelancers, and experts alike can share their knowledge, giving students more choices.

We focus on making education accessible to everyone. By removing old barriers, we create a space that values local talent and practical skills. Teachers can design engaging lessons that truly connect with students, leading to better learning outcomes. In short, our platform builds an inclusive environment where independent educators and motivated learners work together to improve online education.

# **Project Objectives**
The project aims to build a **personalized learning platform** where teachers offer courses on the platform, while students are able to join the courses provided by teachers.

## **Technical Implementation Approach**

The platform will be built using a **Next.js full-stack approach** combined with an **Express.js backend** for API handling. This hybrid architecture leverages the benefits of **server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and API routes** in Next.js while maintaining the flexibility of an Express.js backend for complex API logic.

### **Why This Approach?**
- **Scalability**: Next.js allows optimized performance with its hybrid rendering model.
- **Developer Efficiency**: Full-stack Next.js minimizes the need for separate frontend and backend hosting.
- **Performance**: SSR improves SEO and reduces load times, especially for dynamic course content.
- **Flexibility**: Express.js provides a lightweight yet powerful backend for API handling.

## **Cloud storage for dataset files**

To efficiently manage and store user-uploaded files, the platform will utilize an **external cloud storage service** instead of local storage. This approach ensures **scalability, reliability, and accessibility** while reducing server load.

### **Storage Use Cases**
- **Assignment Submissions**: Students upload assignment files (e.g., PDFs, DOCX, images).
- **Course Materials**: Teachers upload course-related files such as lecture slides, handouts, and resources.

### **Cloud Storage Solution**
- **Service Considerations**:
  - AWS S3
  - Google Cloud Storage
  - Firebase Storage

### **Why Cloud Storage?**
- **Scalability**: Handles large file volumes without increasing server strain.
- **Security**: Built-in encryption and access control mechanisms.
- **Reliability**: Ensures high availability and redundancy to prevent data loss.
- **Performance**: Offloads file handling from the main application server, reducing load times.

This cloud storage integration enhances the platform's ability to securely store and manage educational content while ensuring accessibility across devices.
