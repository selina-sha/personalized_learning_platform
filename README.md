# Motivation

Our online education platform fills a gap by offering a fair space for all educators and learners. Unlike traditional platforms that require teachers to be linked with big institutions, our site lets anyone sign up without complex rules or strict tests. This way, hobbyists, freelancers, and experts alike can share their knowledge, giving students more choices.

We focus on making education accessible to everyone. By removing old barriers, we create a space that values local talent and practical skills. Teachers can design engaging lessons that truly connect with students, leading to better learning outcomes. In short, our platform builds an inclusive environment where independent educators and motivated learners work together to improve online education.

# **Project Objectives**

The project aims to build a personalized learning platform where teachers offer courses on the platform, while students are able to join the courses provided by teachers.

# Technical Stack

The platform is built using a **Next.js full-stack approach**, leveraging **server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and API routes** for backend logic. This approach ensures a seamless and efficient development experience while maintaining high performance. To efficiently manage and store user-uploaded files, the platform utilizes an **external cloud storage service** (Supabase) instead of local storage. This approach ensures **scalability, reliability, and accessibility** while reducing server load.

# **Lessons Learned**

## Iterative Data Modeling & API Contract Design

We began with a simple Prisma schema and clear API docs, which helped us move fast. When users ran into issues like signing up for the same course twice or using nested folders, we updated the schema and managed versions carefully. Writing small, stepâ€‘byâ€‘step migrations from the start made those changes much easier.

## Balancing Next.js Rendering Modes & Cloud Storage Integration

We used Next.jsâ€™s builtâ€‘in page rendering features together with Supabase for file uploads, which gave us fastâ€‘loading pages and made development much smoother.

# **Concluding Remarks**

Overall, this project successfully delivered an inclusive, scalable learning platform that empowers any educator to share expertise and any learner to access diverse courses. By combining a robust relational schema, endâ€‘toâ€‘end type safety in TypeScript, and cloudâ€‘native storage, we met our objectives for performance, reliability, and ease of use. Moving forward, we can build on this foundation with features like realâ€‘time notifications, analytics dashboards, and more granular permissions to further enhance the teaching and learning experience.
