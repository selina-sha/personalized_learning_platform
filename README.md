# Motivation

Our online education platform fills a gap by offering a fair space for all educators and learners. Unlike traditional platforms that require teachers to be linked with big institutions, our site lets anyone sign up without complex rules or strict tests. This way, hobbyists, freelancers, and experts alike can share their knowledge, giving students more choices.

We focus on making education accessible to everyone. By removing old barriers, we create a space that values local talent and practical skills. Teachers can design engaging lessons that truly connect with students, leading to better learning outcomes. In short, our platform builds an inclusive environment where independent educators and motivated learners work together to improve online education.

# **Project Objectives**

The project aims to build a personalized learning platform where teachers offer courses on the platform, while students are able to join the courses provided by teachers.

# Technical Stack

The platform is built using a **Next.js full-stack approach**, leveraging **server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and API routes** for backend logic. This approach ensures a seamless and efficient development experience while maintaining high performance. To efficiently manage and store user-uploaded files, the platform utilizes an **external cloud storage service** (Supabase) instead of local storage. This approach ensures **scalability, reliability, and accessibility** while reducing server load.

# **Development Guide**

## Environment Setup

The project requires:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and `npm`
- A running **PostgreSQL** instance
- A **Supabase** account for file storage

---

## Setup Script

We provide a bash script to automate environment configuration:

```
#!/bin/bash

echo "Setting up environment..."

# Prompt for DB username
read -p "Enter your PostgreSQL username: " db_user

# Create .env file from template
cp env_example .env

# Replace the default username with the user's input
sed -i '' "s/user@localhost/${db_user}@localhost/" .env

# Run setup commands
echo "Installing dependencies..."
npm install

echo "Generating Prisma client..."
npx prisma generate

echo "Setup complete. .env configured with username '${db_user}'"
echo "Run the server with: npm run dev"
```

---

## .env File Configuration

Your `.env` file should include the following environment variables:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user@localhost:5432/dbname
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
```

---

## Database Initialization

Once your `.env` is configured:

1. Create the database manually or through a GUI like `psql` or TablePlus.
2. Run the Prisma migrations to set up your schema:

```
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

---

## Cloud Storage Configuration (Supabase)

We use Supabase for managing file uploads:

- A Supabase bucket (e.g., `course-materials`) must be created.
- Files are uploaded via server routes using the **Service Role Key** for full access.
- Students download materials using **signed URLs** for secure, temporary access.

Note: Only private buckets are supported.

---

## Local Development and Testing

You can run the development server using:

```
npm run dev
```

### Tools:

- **Prisma Studio**: to browse and edit your data

```
npx prisma studio
```

- Local testing: The full functionality of the platform can be tested locally, including user authentication, course creation and editing, file upload and retrieval, student enrollment, assignment publishing, and student submissions. This allows end-to-end validation without needing to deploy to production.

# **Lessons Learned**

## Iterative Data Modeling & API Contract Design

We began with a simple Prisma schema and clear API docs, which helped us move fast. When users ran into issues like signing up for the same course twice or using nested folders, we updated the schema and managed versions carefully. Writing small, stepâ€‘byâ€‘step migrations from the start made those changes much easier.

## Balancing Next.js Rendering Modes & Cloud Storage Integration

We used Next.jsâ€™s builtâ€‘in page rendering features together with Supabase for file uploads, which gave us fastâ€‘loading pages and made development much smoother.

# **Concluding Remarks**

Overall, this project successfully delivered an inclusive, scalable learning platform that empowers any educator to share expertise and any learner to access diverse courses. By combining a robust relational schema, endâ€‘toâ€‘end type safety in TypeScript, and cloudâ€‘native storage, we met our objectives for performance, reliability, and ease of use. Moving forward, we can build on this foundation with features like realâ€‘time notifications, analytics dashboards, and more granular permissions to further enhance the teaching and learning experience.
